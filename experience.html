                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>With a Master of Science in Computer Science from Northern Arizona University, supplemented by hands-on experience as a Software Application Developer at Accenture Solutions Pvt. Ltd., I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team.</p>
                <p>My educational background has equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science principles and programming languages, including Java, Python, R, C, and C++. Moreover, my coursework and projects have honed my skills in data management, analytics, and web development. Notably, I have led initiatives such as building a data warehouse using dimensional modeling, which involved leveraging tools like Microsoft Access and MySQL to analyze healthcare datasets sourced from platforms like Kaggle.</p>

With over 3+ years of experience in data engineering and AWS cloud services, I have a proven track record of designing, implementing, and optimizing data architectures to support scalable, secure, and high-performance analytics solutions • Led stakeholder requirements sessions to align on-premises infrastructure with AWS capabilities and conducted detailed meetings with stakeholders to understand existing infrastructure, data sources, and compliance requirements, ensuring a clear roadmap for transitioning to AWS cloud solutions. • Designed and deployed secure and developed a robust AWS architecture incorporating Amazon S3 for scalable storage, Amazon Redshift for efficient data warehousing, and Amazon QuickSight for dynamic data visualization, optimizing overall data accessibility and migration processes. • Orchestrated setup of AWS resources and established and configured essential AWS resources including EC2 instances for compute capacity, VPCs for network isolation, and IAM roles for secure access management, creating a secure and isolated environment for data migration and processing. • Conducted comprehensive data mapping and schema design for Amazon Redshift: Created detailed data mapping and schema designs, defining source-to-destination transformations and designing target schemas for Amazon Redshift to ensure accurate and seamless integration of diverse data sources. • Utilized AWS Glue and PySpark running on AWS EMR to perform efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, transforming and cleaning data to enhance data quality and integrity. • Utilized AWS DMS for seamless extraction and migration of on-premises databases while Employing AWS Data Migration Service (DMS) to facilitate the extraction and migration of on-premises databases to AWS cloud storage, ensuring an efficient and reliable data transfer process. • Optimized data loading into Amazon Redshift and S3 and enhanced the performance of data storage and retrieval by optimizing the data loading processes into Amazon Redshift and S3, ensuring scalable analytics and efficient reporting capabilities. • Executed rigorous data validation post-migration and conducted extensive data validation and testing activities following data migration, ensuring the accuracy, integrity, and completeness of the data across AWS environments. • Conducted performance testing and query optimization on Amazon Redshift and Performed thorough performance testing and query optimization on Amazon Redshift, improving data processing efficiency and enabling faster access to critical insights for stakeholders. • Created user-friendly and interactive dashboards and reports using Amazon QuickSight, providing stakeholders with valuable business insights and facilitating informed decision-making. • Implemented AWS KMS and IAM policies for data encryption and compliance and Applied AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and IAM policies to implement robust data encryption and access control measures, ensuring data security and adherence to regulatory requirements such as HIPAA. • Leveraged Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for data analysis and machine learning and Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to perform advanced data analysis and machine learning tasks, leveraging Python's powerful ecosystem for data-driven solutions. • Developed Python scripts for data preprocessing while Created custom Python scripts to preprocess and clean large datasets, enhancing data quality and preparing data for accurate modeling and analysis. • Implemented machine learning models (Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Random Forest) in Python, Developed and deployed machine learning models using algorithms like Gaussian Naïve Bayes and Random Forest, generating predictive insights and supporting data-driven decision-making processes. • Integrated Java applications with AWS services (S3, Lambda) and Enhanced data processing capabilities by integrating Java applications with AWS services such as Amazon S3 for storage and AWS Lambda for serverless computing, ensuring scalable and efficient backend solutions. • Developed RESTful APIs and backend services in Java and Designed and developed RESTful APIs and backend services using Java, facilitating seamless integration of data processing workflows with AWS infrastructure and enhancing overall system performance.                <p>Furthermore, my experience as a Teaching Assistant at Northern Arizona University has enhanced my communication and organizational skills. In this capacity, I provided support to students in courses such as Data Structures (C, C++) and Principles of Programming Language (Python), fostering their understanding of complex concepts through individual tutoring sessions and grading assistance. Moreover, my involvement as a Volunteer Student Ambassador underscores my commitment to academic excellence and community engagement.</p>
                <p>I am particularly drawn to innovation and commitment to driving positive change through technology. I am eager to leverage my skills and experience continuing to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
